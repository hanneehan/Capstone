       "array([\"In a city where the best Vietnamese food can often be found outside of a restaurant, pho cam ly strives to change the norm.  Right away one might think that this is just another pho restaurant that caters to Americans because it is nestled on the beautiful Magazine street in uptown. I sure did. But I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong. First, the menu isn't by any means limited. Along with offering a wide variety of pho and com dishes, I was delighted to see bun bo hue on the menu (though I admit I haven't tried it yet). I've been disappointed too many times to see the dish not included on other menus, so that was a plus. Second,  the dish I ordered, pho chin gan, was very delicious. Not only were they generous with their meat portion, the soup wasn't too oily. Too often I've left pho restaurants too full of oil that I end up being a couch potato the rest of the day. However, I did have a bite of my girlfriend's pho ga and the chicken was disappointing. It was quite dry and made her meal less satisfying.\\nAnother reason I enjoy pho cam ly is the excitement of the pho challenge. A whopping bowl consisting of two pounds of meat and another two pounds of noodles awaits anyone with nerves of steel, four stomaches and 40 bucks (plus tax). I took on the challenge and failed terribly but the waiters were quite encouraging and made my failure a little less saddening.\\nI encourage anyone to come here. Not only do you get a good meal, there's always a chance you'll get a show too.\",\n",
       "       \"Yay, a restaurant that is open on Monday!\\n\\nI was craving pho and I didn't want to drive all the way to the West Bank. I wanted something on my route to home from work, and I found Pho Cam Ly on Yelp.\\n\\nI ordered the small Pho Tai and a Grilled Pork Bahn Mi. The small pho was a pretty good sized bowl. I was almost too full to eat any of my Bahn Mi, but I am greedy and ate half of it any way. I got the other half to go.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the pho. I didn't even put any sriracha in the broth until I was 2/3 of the way done (I love sriracha in my pho but I was savoring the broth in its original flavors before I added anything to it later). The grilled pork in the bahn mi was less exciting than some other Vietnamese restaurants, but it was a decent sandwich by all means.\\n\\nI will surely be returning.\",\n",
       "       \"I don't eat very often in St. Albert but I was in the area after a soccer tournament and a bunch of my teammates and I were craving in pho. Someone suggested Pho Anh Sang so we went there to satisfy our pho cravings. \\n\\nPlace is your typical Vietnamese restaurant - couple tables, bare and simplistic. Who cares though? As long as the food is good, I'm happy! So to the food, we ordered a couple of appetizers to share and each our own vermicilli noodles/bowls of pho. I'll just tell you what I had/tasted.\\n\\n- Fried spring rolls ($4) - you get four and comes with dipping sauce. Crunchy. Decent but nothing that you can't get elsewhere.\\n- Fresh rolls ($4) - you get two rolls cut into four pieces. I like these more but maybe I'm just biased in general?\\n- Pho ga ($9 for large) - tasty simple broth. Good amount of noodles and comes with the usual sides.\\n\\nI didn't have it but the vietnamese ice coffee ($3-4) looked really good. They put it through one of those mini sifters, then you mix it with the condensed milk at the bottom of your cup and then pour it into a cup with ice. I don't drink coffee but this looked delicious! Same for their mango bubble tea ($4). YUM.\\n\\nGood Vietnamese place in St. Albert if your craving pho or something cheap and delicious. Give it a try. They even accept cards surprisingly!\",\n",
       "       \"I don't usually head to St. Albert for pho, but I had to be there for business reasons on such a cold and snowy day that I was craving a bowl of Vietnamese noodle soup badly. Pho Anh Sang is one of the handful of Vietnamese restaurants in St. Albert and was reasonably close to where we had to be, so we ventured there for lunch.\\n\\nThe interior looked pretty much like most of the pho places I have been - plain tables and chairs with no-frills as far as decorating goes. Menu choices and prices are also in line with other Vietnamese restaurants. Bowls of pho will run you six or seven dollars depending on size, vermicelli bowls around seven or eight, and there is a variety of other dishes incorporating meat and noodles. \\n\\nWe started off with an order of onion cakes. They were served hot and crispy in a basket, without being greasy. A couple of plates would have been nice, but otherwise the cakes were quite enjoyable.\\n\\nOf course, I had a small bowl of Pho Tai (medium steak). It was piping hot from start to finish, had a decent amount of meat and noodles, and a good tasting broth. I wasn't blown away by any one element of the soup, but it certainly hit the spot.\\n\\nHe had a grilled chicken vermicelli bowl. I tasted a small piece of chicken and it was good, and he was overall happy with his meal. To me, the bowl seemed small, but with a final bill that was only around $20 before the tip, it was economical.\\n\\nIf I am in St. Albert and crave pho, I will definitely head back to Pho Anh Sang and I recommend others do the same.\",\n",
       "       'A little birdie told me that excellent pho can be had in St. Albert so off I went to answer this question: can there actually be good pho in the vanilla suburb of St. Albert?\\n\\nPho Anh Sang is in a strip mall along St. Albert Trail, don\\'t blink as its signage is completely dwarfed by its neighbours: Fatburgers and Subway.  If you blink you would miss it.  Lots of parking so no issue at all.\\n\\nOnce I walked in, the first impression was questionable.  I arrived shortly after the lunch rush, every table was dirty and the somewhat grouchy waitress motioned me towards one of the dirty table, there I sat and waited.  There were a few holes along the wall, the place definitely need a little bit of TLC.  The TV showing the news looked like it has been on continuously since the 80s and the place relied on the two small windows for light, not very bright at all.\\n\\nIt looked like the waitress was doing bookkeeping work at the end table and my arrival had interrupted her.  Eventually she came with tea, menu and a dirty cloth.  She seriously needed to wash that cloth, it reeked of week old food.  After the waitress wiped the table, the entire table smelled sour and unappetizing; I considered walking out after smelling the cloth.  The complimentary tea was really weak and borderline on being classified as warm water.  I quickly ordered the large #36 pho with briskets, tendons and ve don and hoped for the best.\\n\\nThere were the usual assortment of condiments: saracha, hoisin, chili oil, chili sauce, a nice sprig of basil, a small bit of lime and a good amount of sprouts; oh wait, no fresh peppers?  Sadness hit me, they didn\\'t have any of my beloved fresh thai chilis.  \\n\\nThe food service was slower than most pho places, I had enough time to write 3 or 4 emails, which is slow by pho standards.  The bowl arrived steaming hot and smelled fantastic.  I took a spoonful before adding the condiments, it was delicious, a bit lighter than most other restaurants\\' broth but it was good broth; as good as any other broth I have tasted.  Some may argue that it needed salt but I would say that it was perfect; once the appropriate amount of chili oil has been added, of course.\\n\\nToppings wise, there was an adequate amount of meat on top.  The ve don was disappointing, the menu mentioned \"crunchy frank\" but I was served soft overcooked frank slices.  The portion was quite generous though with a good amount of noodles.  At $9.50 for a large, I really can\\'t complain about the value at all.  \\n\\nWhen I was ready to leave, I stood at the cashier counter for a long time, watching commercial after commercial on TV, the waitress never came but eventually the chef himself came out to take my money.  \\n\\nSo, was it worth the drive to St. Albert to experience Pho Anh Sang\\'s bowl of pho, yes it was, the broth was amazing.  Would I stop here again, yes, if I am in the neighbourhood.  Overall, the service was questionable, the staffs can use a little bit of restaurant hygiene training, the place can use some fixing-up but the pho was top notch (skip the ve don though) - take out may be a good alternative here.',\n",
       "       \"Delicious Vietnamese restaurant on Magazine street! I came in with a friend on a Thursday night around 7:45. We started with shrimp spring rolls that were very yummy, I especially loved the peanut sauce that came with them! We also both ordered pho. The pho was delicious! I really like that they have small and large sizes of pho and that there are a variety of flavors to choose from! I had the shrimp pho with chicken broth instead of beef broth. The broth was very flavorful and the small was still a huge bowl!

For a little extra you can be served a larger bowl of pho, but be warned that the larger portions of Pho where simply too much to is pho lovers, so I recommend only ordering a regular portion.

My experience here did not disappoint.\\n\\nI met a friend here for lunch and walking in, I was immediately blown away by the renovations that had been done to the place. Small world time: after I checked in here, a woman on twitter informed me that her husband was the one who did all of the renovations (I swear, I think I am linked to everyone in this town via social media). Kudos to him! There is a gorgeous wood floor and plenty of tables and space. You would never guess that this place is as a big as it is, just by looking at it from the outside.\\n\\nI was in a coffee mood, so I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee so that I would have some caffeine to sip on. As for the food: this place has everything you could imagine. In fact, I think that they have the most expansive menu of any Vietnamese restaurant in the area. For an appetizer, we decided on the spring roll with pork patties. This came with two large rolls to and order and it was fantastic. The pork was tender and had a lot of flavor. For my entree, I got the raw eye of round and brisket pho. I found that the broth had A LOT of flavor and a bit of that earthy quality that i like in a good bowl. The meat was perfect and there was a lot of it. I definitely left here full and satisfied.\\n\\nIf you are feeling adventurous, you can always try the Pho challenge: finish a huge bowl of two pounds of meat and two pounds of noodles in one hour and it's free. If you fail, you gotta fork over $30. I have no idea if anyone has actually completed this challenge, but I could see it making for an interesting UYE, if anyone is ever hungry enough.\\n\\nI will definitely return to Pho Cam Ly. I am putting it up there with Tan Dinh, Pho Bang (on Manhattan) and Magasin as one of my regular Pho haunts.\",\n",

The service was good. \\n\\nThe price as very cheap for the area, but the food was alright. The spring rolls lacked any flavor because they only had meat, noodles, and avocados (that I added for $1). Traditional Vietnamese restaurants stuff their spring rolls with lots of vegetables! They did have steamed bun tacos, but the selection was basic. I got the pork one, and the meat was very dry. There was too much of only carrots, so the flavor was overwhelming, and the actual bun was dry instead of fluffy like it should be. The pho broth is slightly salter than my liking. The rice plate with chicken tasted good though! I don't think I will be visiting again unless I come with friends to see them do the pho challenge. \\n\\nPho Challenge: 2lb of meat 2lb of soup. 1 hr.

Another good sign is that it is very clean.\\n\\nMy friends have been talking about how this place had the best peanut beef sate pho and had to take me to it to try it.

Apparently this is their most popular dish ($12).  I do admit, the broth was very spicy and I loved it.  Maybe I've been spoil from my fave go to pho place, Co Do Hue, where you get ample meat in the pho, but I did find this lacking in that area.  If they added more beef to it, this would easily be one of my fave pho's due to the broth.\\n\\nAs for service, we were served by the owner and no complaints there.  Service was excellent, friendly and was always coming by to check on us (also had a nice sense of humour).

She assured me it was no problem. The second she set the soup down I could see it was clearly chicken broth. Despite its yellow color I tasted it to be 100% sure and immediately let her know to which she shouted across the room (without coming to check) that i was wrong, it was the beef broth. I again got her attention and told her it was definitely chicken NOT beef broth- she mostly ignored me - continuing to wait on other customers and mumbled that she would ask the kitchen....I brought it up one more time and was yet again dismissed. I think she assumed I didn't know Pho and would just shut up and eat the wrong the soup. Which is essentially what I had to do and not cool at all- but I wasn't in the mood to make a scene....Very disappointing as I'm visiting from out of state and this was my last chance to get pho in the area. \\n\\nSide notes. The lettuce in fresh tofu spring rolls was so brown it made them inedible. The avocado smoothie was good. \\n\\nI hate leaving bad reviews but the dismissive attitude and inability to do something as simple as remaking the soup I paid $10 for was unacceptable.\",\n",

My group really enjoyed the Pho. Now I did not especially like the meatballs. These were not like Italian meatballs. Kind of chewy so in typical pho fashion I just left the majority out of my soup.\\nWe also decided to go with a Vietnamese beef hoagie. It was the best Vietnamese beef sandwich I have ever had.

We started with Goi Cuon (spring rolls) - beautifully rolled shrimp and pork rolls lettuce, cucumber, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro wrapped in rice paper, accompanied by traditional peanut dipping sauce.  All of the ingredients are fresh and crisp, and the flavors well balanced.  The sauce is on the thin side, which means you have to dip more often.   A minor nit - if the appetizer is to be shared, plates are needed.  It's impossible to eat one of these without spillage! \\n\\nNext is the special beef pho.   A traditional size (BIG) bowl of flavorful beef broth, brimming with sliced beef, halved meat balls, tendon, tripe and brisket, a ball of thin rice noodles, topped with scallions and sliced onions.  Bean sprouts, cilantro, basil and sliced jalepenos are served on the side.  The pho was very good, though the noodles were a little soggy. \\n\\nWe also tried the Banh Mi Chay.  A beautifully prepared sandwich stuffed with seasoned tofu, cucumbers, pickled carrots and cilantro and a house made mayo.

I highly suggest you order these dishes if you've never tried vietnamese food before or are overwhelmed by the menu. These 3 dishes were more than enough for 2 people and we had leftovers to take home.\\n\\nThe pho comes in a HUGE bowl, with a generous amount of beef that's cooked medium-rare. You can put it under your noodles if you want it to cook the meat more. You can add basil or bean sprouts and cilantro to your pho by letting it cook under the noodles. Best pho I've ever had! The soup broth taste is spot on and the beef is so tender and the noodles are delicious.\\n\\nAs for the shaking beef dish, it too comes with a generous amount of beef that's served on a bed of watercress and a couple of tomato slices. The beef was so juicy and I loved the sauce that's paired with it. It also comes with a huge mountain of rice. Most asian restaurants I've been to are quite stingy on the amount of rice they give you or even charge you extra for rice, but here, they give you enough rice to share with another person.\\n\\nWe also ordered iced coffee for the long drive home and it's seriously like jet fuel. It's some powerful coffee, if you need a wake me up! But don't worry, it doesn't taste like fuel. It's creamy, not too sweet and quite refreshing on a hot, summer day.

I did not know this before until my husband's mom made for me but in vegetarian style. It literally tastes the same as my mother-in-law's version. I can eat crab meat so it is even better.

I do have to agree with the below post.... at times the pho has been unbelievable (just as good as the best pho I had when visiting Vietnam), but I have had a single experience when I had to question whether I was at the same restaurant I remembered. Perhaps it was the chef that night. The broth makes or breaks the pho and I guess they just got it wrong. Anyway, that was just one experience. All others have been fabulous.

If you are ready to order close your menu and put it down. They'll let you sit with the menu for half an hour if they think you're still looking. Next, don't feel neglected if they don't come by to check on you, fill your drink, etc. You'll have to get their attention- don't feel rude.

I really liked the pho, but it was a standard pho.  It's almost like getting steamed white rice from A,B,C... X,Y,Z.  Only way to really mess it up is to burn it.

It was only OK for me because it was more creamy and heavy than it was fruity.  But other than that, it was perfectly fine.  It's just the difference in peoples' taste profiles.\\n\\nI also like the staff.  They are all very friendly.  This was my second time here (well technically first for me). The first time I came here was to only get carry-out for my clients.  I got them either fish or seafood congee (which they really enjoyed).

What I am certain of is that it is very likely that I will go back.  I say 'likely' only because I don't really live close by.

The variety adds richness to the dish, and it's a great introduction to gauge your preferred cuts. And of course, the variety of sauces at each table and complimentary fresh herbs, without which the dish feels incomplete. \\n\\nI've also had the vietnamese crepe (pork) and summer rolls. The crepe dish was interesting and featured crispy, eggy crepe paired with a meat. Although the textures were done well, and we paired it with a bunch of the fresh herbs at our table, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. The summer rolls were good too.

You definitely don't have to worry about social distancing here during COVID-19 times.  Their menu was quite large compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  We ordered the beef pho, crispy egg noodles topped with tofu & mixed vegetables, and the house special rice vermicelli bowl (spring rolls/meatballs/charbroiled chicken/shrimp).  The beef pho was pretty small for what it was.  There weren't that many toppings.  The crispy noodles were fresh, hot, and crispy.  The vermicelli bowl had a lot of toppings and was delicious.  I would probably skip the beef pho but get the vermicelli bowl next time.  Service was very fast and friendly.  It was a decent place but I feel like there are better Vietnamese places (Pho 75 and Pho Ha) in the area.\",\n",
       "       \"I got the beef pho, and it was really good. Broth was somewhat customizable with a cup of spicy paste you could add if you like your broth spicy. The things I didn't like:\\n1) they don't cook the meat that they is in the pho (if you get takeout). the idea is, you pour the hot broth over the meat, onions, noodles, and bean sprouts and the heat fully cooks the meat. Since I was taking out, I'm not sure if my broth cooled down, or what, but I was fairly convinced after pouring the broth on the meat it wasn't fully cooked. \\n2) they were very heavy on the bean sprouts and onions. I like bean sprouts and onions for the texture, but I would've rather had more noodles and less bean sprouts and onions. \\n\\nAll in all, a very good place, especially because they just opened a couple of weeks ago. I will definitely be back but probably get the vegetarian pho, and ask for light bean sprouts/onions\\n\\nCame back again next day.

Then ee noticed that tables around us began to receive food and they eere seated after us. We tried to call the waiter over several times with no sucess. Finally we got the attention of the man behind the counter.  He came over and took our order. Then we waited again. My boyfriend ordered pho with cubed ribeye. Hr received his pho first.

Noodles and soup, onion rings, green onion, and cilantro.  I usually get the Pho Tai (rare sliced beef that cooks in the hot broth right before your eyes)- I guess I like watching it cook before my eyes and it's chewy but lean.  I also add a healthy dose of Sriracha and Hoisin.  I have seen people put the Sriracha and Hoisin in a separate plate and then dip their meat into it before eating.  I skip that extra plate and put the sauce straight in.  Does this make me weird and nontraditional?  Well I am weird and nontraditional, and proud!  I am an Asian tourist in the world of Asian cuisine.  Give me credit that I use chopsticks finally, lol...\\nAnyway- scenery wise this place is in a depressing plaza and the restaurant itself is kind of depressing too.

For lunch, I ordered item no.9, egg roll (5) priced for 3.00 and item no. 35, Ph TÃ¡i Sat priced for 6.95. Included tip, my lunch was 12 dollar. Portion of the pho was generous as well as side dishes such as bean spouts, jalapeno pepper and Thai basil . The soup has unique flavor because it was mixed with peanut sauce. Combined with spice, chili and beef stock, Ph Tai Sat differs itself from other everyday pho dishes. Restaurant is small and clean. Service is quick. There were two Vietnamese families dinning during the lunch and they ordered many dishes to share. They ate them all which is a good sign. \\n\\nThe hate side: Because the service is quick, my server gave me roughly two minute to read through the menu. For a person who is still learning about the Vietnamese cuisine, I really would like to take few more minutes to look through dishes more closely, not mentioned I drove from Oldsmar to check it out. I guess it was lunch time and they were busy so my server played the tune \"time is money\" to me with a absolutely emotionless face. Well, time is money. My orders was on my table in 5 minutes.

It's a rich flavor from whatever they're using to make the broth - I wish I knew their secret! \\n\\nService is fast - moments after being seated, the server brought over hot tea and took our orders. Summer rolls were on the table in a few minutes, and as soon as we'd finished the rolls, the pho was in front of us. The servers are attentive but they don't hover.

The broth had the lingering taste of mushroom, which was not my preference. However, there was a generous and diverse selection of veggies. \\n\\nI can't really hold the mushroom incident against them, so I was tempted to give them 4 stars. However, the bean sprouts that they served up were brown. I can handle a little brown, but these were so discolored that we didn't place a single one in our pho.

I was seated and served quickly.  I ordered summer rolls with chicken and shrimp and rib eye steak pho.  The girlfriend ordered chicken pho.  Both the rolls and the pho were simply okay.  The rolls really lacked flavor.  I kept thinking pork was the way to go.  The pho was decent.  HUGE portion and good broth, but nothing that was drawing me in for another bite.  While I admittedly not a pho connoisseur, I have had pho (out in San Francisco) that did blow me away, so I at least have some perspective.

The food came out in lighting speed. No more than 4-5 mins after I placed my order- I had a steaming hot bowl of Pho in front of me. **This is definitely a plus when considering somewhere to eat on lunch break** The Pho was good, not great in my opinion. Although. maybe I just picked the wrong combination of meats for my tastebuds. The well done flank was a tad dry, and the fat brisket was unedible. I pictured melt-in- your-mouth fatty, tender pieces of brisket. What I got was large, stringy, chewy gag-worthy fat pieces. I picked all of these out of my meal after attempting to chew and swallow the first piece. Even with the brisket fiasco, the bowl of Pho filled me up. It was warm and flavorful. One thing that bothered me was that there were no labels in english on the condiments on the table. I  recognize that alot of Vietnamese eat here and they don't need them, but the rest of us who can't read vietnamese do! It would have been appeciated.

Having grown up around this neighbourhood and frequented the last few restaurant incarnations of this strip mall, I regret not having tried Pho & Bun sooner!\\n\\nBoth our Pho had great broth, really distinct flavours of lemongrass, star anise, black cardamom - homemade and delicious.  Mine was spicy (hue style I think) with vermicelli, beef shank and pork, accented with shrimp paste and lemongrass. A perfect balance of both was achieved; I find either can be overwhelming but particularly shrimp paste must be used judiciously. I enjoyed it tremendously and didn't need to add extra spice to it, which is really saying something.   My BF, seeking comfort food, chose the simple chicken broth pho, which was delicious in it's simplicity.  The meat portions in the pho were very genereous and of high quality, not fatty or tough.  Very filling pho indeed!\\n\\nI also had one of the best fluffy-style (versus pancake style - I hope you know what I mean) green onion cakes I've ever had, not at all greasy, really puffy and perfectly cooked.  We both had bubble tea (one milk, one tea latte), which was average in flavour but well blended and generous.  The boba were a bit chewy.  Not bad, just above mall quality perhaps, but far from the standard of our favourite bubble tea joint.\\n\\nAs others have noted the owner Tina is a grouch, she barely acknowledges you and is not very engaged in the role of customer service despite acting as a server.  She all but ignored us after we made our orders, and we had to go up to ask for to-go packages (interrupting her in the middle of making a personal phone call on speaker phone).  She's so stand-offish that one gets the impression she doesn't speak english - no way, her english is perfect, she's just all business I think (check out the large family portrait on the back wall - one gets the idea of the temperments of the different members of the family!).  Anyhow, a chef came out early on to clean up plates that Tina apparently was in no hurry to do so herself despite there being only 3 tables occupied, and he smiled and acknowledged us, as did other folks who dropped off dishes at our table.  \\n\\nSo never mind the potential for a chilly reception, the food is just excellent.

Not even if I was crazy craving Vietnamese food would I go again to Bamboo because my disappointment would be worse than the craving. Come to Pho Now to taste what really good pho broth SHOULD taste like. \\n\\nIced Vietnamese Coffee: most places will have the coffee ready to go in their fridge (they just have to add ice and condensed milk to the glass), but you get fresh dripped coffee here! It drips into a cup with condensed milk on the bottom. You just mix the coffee and condensed milk together once the coffee is done and pour it into your glass of ice! The taste is amazing!\\n\\nCrispy Egg Rolls: the filling is pork and chicken. Fried to crispy perfection! Pricey for egg rolls, but there's something about Vietnamese egg rolls that makes their taste unique compared to Chinese egg rolls and worth the extra cost. BTW, the leafy greens and sliced carrots and daikon are not just garnishes for the plate. Wrap up your crispy egg rolls in a leafy green and add some sliced carrots and daikon for extra flavor and texture in your mouth!\\n\\nBeef Pho with brisket and flank: I already mentioned that the broth was legit good. The beef is very high quality too! Just good and simple beef pho.\\n\\nGrilled Pork Chop Fried Rice: the plate comes with two charbroiled pork chops with a delicious green onion/lemongrass sauce.

The broth was delicious, a perfect balance between subtle and flavourful. It was spicy enough to have bite, but not so much that you sweat like an animal. I was also surprised that the veggies that accompanied the soup were fresh. There were no black splotches on the leaves that some places have. The salad rolls were also fresh and soft and went perfectly with the accompanying peanut sauce. Thirdly, I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The gentle orange colour of the place gave it a warm feel. This place is owned by a single family. You can tell because there is a old picture on the wall of the family when the restaurant first opened and your servers are the kids in that picture.

       "       \"Pho & Bun is very much a small, family run business. The walls are decorated with pictures of the owners/staff, and the decor is very home-y. Every time I come here I vaguely feel like I'm intruding at someone's house for dinner.  \\n\\nThe service is very minimal. You get in, you get seated, they take your order, bring your food, done. Don't expect refills on drinks and if you need something, you're going to have to flag someone down. That being said, the food is VERY fast to come out. Within 2 minutes of ordering, my salad rolls were out. 5 minutes after that, my pho came. Super, super quick!\\n\\nThe food itself is pretty good. Pho broth is flavourful and there are a whole bunch of options available. I took stars off because of the pricing and portions. The food here is a lot pricier than other Vietnamese places around the city, with smaller portions of food. $12 for the bowl of House Pho, which left me still hungry after eating all of it and I am usually stuffed to the max 3/4 of the way through a bowl of pho. \\n\\nUltimately, it fills a niche in the very sparse selection of restaurants in the Capilano/Holyrood area, but it's not worth seeking out as a place to eat.\",\n",
       "       \"A fantastic Pho place in the western suburbs.  \\n\\nIf you live in West Chester, Downingtown, Exton or Coatesville you owe it to yourself to check this place out.  The restaurant is brightly lit and casual as one would expect for a Pho place.  The Pho has been consistently delicious and I've stopped going to the pho place in West Chester downtown once I found this place.\\n\\nThe portions are always just right, and they put various fresh fruits in their water pitchers to infuse it with a little bit of extra freshness and sweetness that I've never seen before at a casual ethnic cuisine.  This is definitely something that puts Pho Now above their peers.  The beef broth has been flavorful without being overly salty or greasy and all their fresh wrapped summers rolls are not dried out on the outside.  \\n\\nIf you are craving a nice bowl of hot Pho in the area, you can't beat Pho Now.\",\n",

Service gotten very good after a rough start. This is a very good option in the area. Sampled many items since the place opened but it was all take out. Until recently. ALL items are Excellent. And the Pho broth is very good. \\nThe needs improvement: The Pho is the essence here. And I have a few recommendations that will improve the Pho experience to be on par with the best:  The serving bowls must be heated. My Pho got cold halfway through my meal. The eye round was sliced thick. A thinner slice would be so much more tender and enjoyable. And my last small recommendation. Can we get hoisin sauce in a smaller bottle? More control to squeeze just a tad.\",\n",

Both appetizers were very good. \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the Superbowl of Pho Dac  Biet, the combination beef noodle soup. This massive bowl was chock full of meatballs, sliced beef, brisket, tendon, and tripe. It was delicious. The broth needed a little salt, but then again, I am a saltaholic. The Superbowl was so large that I had leftover pho for days! \\n\\nMy friend order the Pho Ga, the chicken pho and she enjoyed her food, as well.\\n\\nIf you don't mind a minimally decorated remodeled Pizza Hut that serves delicious no-frills Vietnamese cuisine, this is definitely the place for you.

We decided to get takeout which was a good choice, since the AC wasn't working in the restaurant and it was very hot and steamy. That didn't seem to stop plenty of others from eating here, it was packed on a Saturday lunchtime, but I wouldn't want to eat a hot steamy bowl of pho in a hot restaurant.\\n\\nRegardless, the broth was completely delicious, the toppings were plentiful and herb-filled, and lots of flavor in the dish. That helped balance out the chicken, which tasted like plain boiled chicken without any flavor at all, rather rubbery. I will try other meats with the pho next time. $10.50 gets you a 'superbowl' of any kind of meat you want, while the small bowl is $8.\\n\\nMy partner got the vermicelli noodles with three meats (pork, chicken, and steak for $12) and all three were very flavorful and yummy. I guess they don't want the chicken in the pho competing with the other flavors, but for my taste it was the one disappointing part about the pho. I will still definitely be back for more different types of pho and probably will continue to get takeout, since the atmosphere inside wasn't that great.

The decor was nice and the waitress was friendly... however, when it came down to the food it was just okay. I ordered my usual large phi duc biet, got a lot of meat and noodles but the broth was too salty for my liking. I've seen reviews that said the broth is light and tasteless... but my broth was just plain salty. I feel like it wasn't an authentic bowl of Vietnamese pho. Felt like the broth was from a carton. Not the authentic hours of boiling need marrow type of broth associated with pho. I might try this place out again to see if they improve or perhaps try something different and change my review but it was just okay.\",\n",

We usually start with the feied potstickers, even though we know that the pho is more than enough food for dinner. They are just too good to pass up. We have had the steak pho and the oxtail pho. Both delicious. I don't like well cooked meat and so I order my slices of meat on the side rather than in the soup. That way I can add it to the soup when im ready to eat it and csn let the soup cook it tp rare. The staff never complains about doing this for me and the steak slices are served on a separate plate, arranged attractively. My granddaught and I also order a fresh coconut to drink from, served cut open at the top with a straw inserted and a spoon so you can dig out the meat after you are done drinking. Out only problem with this place is the plastic chop sticks. The food slips right off them. While I applaud the conservation effort, we bring our own wooden chopsticks and avoid the battle of keeping the food on the sticks. These guys make some of the best pho we have ever eaten.\",\n",
       "       'I moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, where I ate pho regularly.  And I am IN LOVE with pho (pronounced \"fuh,\" by the way).  I crave it like a crazy person.  I was hoping to find some pho in Tampa/Brandon that was just as good as it is in L.A.\\n\\nWell, I was not disappointed - the pho here is AWESOME (I recommend the chicken or pork).  Just like the LA pho I love - fresh, hot, filling, with lime, herbs, and bean sprouts on the side.  And I later found out the chef here is from L.A.!  \\nThe \"fried pancake\" (which I had never had, but was recommended to us by our very kind server) was also delicious - highly recommended.  \\nThey also have delicious iced coffee; I got mine with half-n-half instead of condensed milk because I can\\'t have too much sugar, and it was crazy good.  Their coffee is very rich and strong.\\n\\nPho Viet is in a former Pizza Hut, but don\\'t be deterred - this place is awesome.  They did a great job remodeling the inside--it\\'s very charming, clean, and comfortable.  It would be a great date place!  \\n\\nAND if you\\'re GLUTEN FREE (like me), Vietnamese food is perfect for you.  Most dishes are already gluten-free (rice noodles; the pancake was made with rice and tapioca flour).  But even if a dish is not gluten-free, this place was SO accommodating.  They offered to make dishes without the ingredients with gluten (like soy sauce) and even offered to keep gluten-free soy sauce in the kitchen for regular gluten-free customers (they don\\'t have it yet, but we will probably bring some next time we go).  \\n\\nGREAT food; GREAT service; GREAT prices.  Give this place a try and support a local, family-run restaurant while experiencing some really great ethnic food.',\n",

It wasn't really busy and it's self-seating when you get inside. There is a pretty big dining area. \\n\\nI mainly judge a pho place on their broth. All of the add-ins are usually the same (bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, the noodles, sriracha, hoisin sauce, etc) so it's really up to the broth to bring the whole dish together. I got a tofu noodle soup which I think they had under the South Vietnamese portion of the menu. It came out very quickly and very very hot. I like it very very hot by the way. I've been to places where the pho is lukewarm and soup is supposed to be hot.\\n\\nI added the portions of hoisin and sriracha that I like in my soup and went in for a taste. Sadly, the broth was just okay in my books. It wasn't bland but not the best. I've been to other pho places that add a bit of seasoning to the broth and tend to cook the broth for longer to intensify the flavor. I like the broth to punch me in the face with flavor and this broth didn't do that. It was still pleasant though and edible. It's just not my favorite. I may just try something else when I go here. \\n\\nI will try a few other places around town and see if I can find a place that is reliable and has amazing pho and I'll keep coming to Pho Viet along my journey to find the best pho in/around Brandon.\",\n",
       "       'Dear Pho Viet, or AKA Beef Pho Baby. Thank you for keeping your dining room open, you were our last hope! So many pho restaurants are still take-outs only and as a true pho-eater, I have been distressed and anxious for months until I discovered this place. When I saw that they had the dining in option, I still doubted it (sorry Yelp! COVID-19 made me distrust information on the web, even the Yelp a bit) so we had to call to make sure they were truly open. Our family of four made our way down from New Tampa to Brandon just to enjoy noodles. Yes, send NOODs like my daughter\\'s t-shirt with noodle bowl picture says! Instead, we went to get NOODs. The restaurant was very busy with the Sunday lunch crowd. They only had two servers (one of them may have been a manager, even) but they handled us all like pho serving champs they were.  The pho bowls were ordered and delivered back to our tables within 10 minutes, which is one of the many things I love about ordering pho. Super fast! The broths just  hit the right spots in all of us. I ordered seafood pho and the rest of the fam ordered their beef brisket pho noodles, including our youngest one. She was given a choice of Kids pho noodles for $4.99 which lovingly was annotated as \"Beef Pho Baby.\" \\nI think I may have to change my Instagram handle to that. Thank you!\\nSpread the word, this place is open!',\n",

My boyfriend got the pho ga which is chicken pho and he said it had a good amount of chicken. \\n\\nOverall, pretty good pho restaurant and good service.',\n",
       "       \"I've been wanting to try this place but never got around to doing it. My first impression (atmosphere and cleanliness) wasn't the greatest. I know you should never judge a book by it's cover, but it's just difficult to overlook sometimes. There was this running waterfall feature that has seen better days. It's not attractive and it's the first thing you see when you walk into the restaurant. That's another thing. No one really sees you come into the restaurant because the takeout counter is on the other side of this water feature. I think they should just get rid of it.\\n\\nAnyway, I looked at the menu and noticed that the pho is separated into Southern and Northern style. Apparently there is a difference. I ended up getting the Southern Style pork and shrimp pho. I also got the wonton wrapped shrimp as an appetizer. It was all prepared in a good amount of time. I didn't have to wait too long. I was actually quite impressed with the takeout plastic bowls for the pho. The disposable bowls were very large and I didn't even need to move the contents over to another bowl. All I had to do was pour the chicken bone broth into the bowl. It had bean sprouts, lime, sliced jalapeno peppers, Thai basil, green onions, cilantro, lots of thin slices of pork, and about 4 shrimp. This was much meatier than any other pho I've had in the past. The broth was very mild and still very hot when I poured it into the bowl. My mother mentioned that one bowl was enough for 2 people. She was right. It was very good, but I'll have to try the Northern style pho one day just to compare the two. We also liked the wonton wrapped shrimp. I will go back to try other items.\",\n",
       "       'So, I had a pho craving this afternoon. \\n\\nI\\'ve only been to 5 different pho places in Philly and was thinking about visiting another one this weekend, but the little voice of conscience inside my rumbling stomach was too overpowering as I walked past Pho & Cafe Saigon on my way back to my apartment. As I walked toward this \"restaurant,\" I beheld, with slight discomfort, a man looking at me though the glass door, watching me approach. \\n\\nWhen I reached the door, he opened it in silence, allowing me to come in. That was my server. I said \"hi\" and asked for a table in the nearly empty restaurant. Although he did not respond to my greeting, he did point to some tables, suggesting that I could just pick one. When I sat down, iced tap water was promptly delivered. I ordered a bowl of pho, which arrived with terrific speed, only 2 minutes later. \\n\\nIf you know me, you would know that am a relatively fast eater. Multiply that speed by 2 whenever I am hungry or have a craving. Halfway through my meal, my check was shoved into my face as I was inhaling the pho. When I got up to leave, the server, who was facing me, avoided eye contact and headed straight for the check.\\n\\nI left a 20% tip, as I customarily do. I understand that people need to make a living in good or bad times. I know that in some family-owned businesses, perhaps workers who are family members don\\'t always get paid as they should. I also keep an open mind, with the understanding that some people are not at always at ease with human interactions. However, the server was polite and spoke perfect English when a gentleman in a suit came in. He even asked the man how he was doing and politely seated him. He was suddenly well-versed in customer service skills. Unfortunately, I had to leave and could not observe the rest of this fascinating transformation. \\n\\nConclusions from this experience: \\n\\n1) The food was better than last time I was here. The pho was pretty good. There was a large, flat piece of ligament the size of my hand in the pho, but no big deal - I just set it aside. (+1 from my last rating)\\n\\n2) The service was worse, and it was probably not an off-day. It wouldn\\'t have hurt for the server to wait 3 more minutes to drop the check, once I finish absorbing my pho soup. (-1 from my last rating)\\n\\n3) To maximize your experience, make sure you come here hungry. To get better service, wear a suit and white collared shirt instead of your regular clothes. (I only wore a nice skirt with a cardigan)\\n\\n4) The price isn\\'t bad, but reviewers who think it\\'s cheap are probably not comparing this place to the many other Vietnamese restaurants in Philly (less than $5 for the same amount of pho).\\n\\n5) The location helps it maintain customer inflow. If any other pho restaurant in Philly chose to open an additional location nearby, this place would need some serious upgrading to compete.\\n\\nI will say, though, that this is probably the fastest service I\\'ve ever experienced. My entire dining experience lasted less than 10 minutes.',\n",

It's a small, casual place on the corner.\\n\\nThe menu isn't huge but pretty good for a place of this size, with all the Vietnamese staples like pho, rice, vermicelli,etc. We ordered goi cuon (shrimp and pork spring rolls), chicken pho, and lemongrass garlic chicken with rice. The spring rolls were alright, but the peanut sauce that came with it was a little more vinegary and less salty than is traditional. It wasn't bad, just sort of a surprise. \\n\\nThe chicken pho was large and filling, but the broth could've been better. It had the right amount of salt but lacked the strong, savory chicken flavor you'd expect from pho. Also, the chicken breast pieces were kind of dry. Not the worst pho ever but you can definitely find better options around the city. The sautÃ©ed chicken was a bit lacking in seasoning and used the same thin chicken breast slices as the pho, which wasn't a problem in itself but the meat ended up pretty dry and chewy. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place and was hoping for a good, convenient spot near home, but it just doesn't stack up against the Vietnamese food I'm used to.

Crystal clear with no apparent stewing of chicken for chicken broth, seriously the color of water, clear. Then, when you touched the broth it had this weird gelatinous texture to it, which I'm sure is due to the noodles not being drained after being cooked. The rice noodles are very starchy, I make this at home and if you dont' drain it, the starchiness will make your broth a weird texture. The broth itself didn't really taste like chicken, but more like.. salty water. And then I took a bite of the chicken, and that's when I left.

       "       'During a long bike ride that had us (a friend and myself) teetering very close to this west Philly spot, I remembered this fact and pho was just what we needed to refuel.  I\\'m going to drop some knowledge about pho for you: Pho itself, is breakfast in its motherland.  The hearty bowl contains a good amount of carbs, proteins, and salt.  Those elements are vital to start off a tough working day in the heat (manual farming for example).  So it makes sense to start a day\\'s ride with a bowl.\\n\\nAs soon as we get to Pho & Cafe Saigon, we were immediately thrilled to see outdoor seating.  The last time I can recall eating pho outside was when I was actually in Vietnam.  Sun and pho just makes sense to me.  So without doubt, we were to be eating here.\\n\\nSo then we order the typical bowls, load it up with tripe and different cuts of beef in the ol\\' largest-bowl-you-got variety.  Service is quick, just like any other pho monger.  Bowls came out and there\\'s that unmistakable sense of anticipation of designing your own meal, harking to the traditional South Vietnamese way of eating pho.  After the condiments: thai basil, chile peppers, and mung bean sprouts have been drowned in the pool, we dig in.  Immediately something is awry.  This is not authentic.  There\\'s something missing.  Beefy and unctuous, it\\'s there.  Noodles are nice and firm, check.  The proper spices... nope, I\"m sorry to say it\\'s not quite here.  With pho, a slight hint of anise and roasted ginger are supposed to provide that supporting chord to an already nice tune.  This bowl, however, didn\\'t have it.  So what you\\'re left with is a rather nice bowl of beef noodle soup, very paletable and tasty if this was your first.  If you\\'ve eaten a proper bowl before, this just isn\\'t pho like it\\'s supposed to be.\\n\\nBecause we\\'re strictly pho afficienados, it\\'s all we had.  I cannot comment about the other items on the menu simply because we didn\\'t order it.  Needless to say we finished our bowls, did the typical \\'dredging\\' towards the end in an attempt to muster up any sort of scrap that\\'s hidden below the noodle-exhausted murky waters and bidded adieu.  The price was rather expensive, coming in at over eight dollars for the bowl without any drinks or edible companions on the side.\\n\\nStill though, it\\'s worth a trip on a nice, sunny day to enjoy a bowl of \\'beef-noodle soup\\'.  Sure it\\'s not authentic, nor is it even cheap.  But when you\\'re sitting outside with a full stomach on a brilliantly sunny day, what\\'s there to complain about?',\n",

I'm not sure if it's because I have so many memories attached to this little store in West Philly or what, but nothing seems to compare to the deliciousness of the broth and the tenderness of the beef.\\n\\nI could never get enough of the pho tai here. It's just literally so good. The price is reasonable, and you can even ask for a large size which bumps the price up to around $11 or $12. Very, very, worth it. The noodles are perfect and the broth isn't too oily like it is at many pho places.\\n\\nThey have delicious bubble tea smoothies here as well. There are a lot of variety in the flavors you can choose. Seriously, where else would you be able to get a durian smoothie?\\n\\nSo why am I giving this place 3 stars? Honestly, I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. The food itself is great. The owner is actually extremely friendly. There are just some issues that I have with this place... Sanitation being one of them. There was a huge fly flying around once and it really bothered me that it was landing everywhere (bean sprouts included) and the owner didn't even make an attempt to wave the bug away. Another time, there was a bug in my soup (gross) and I asked to have the bowl of pho remade. They remade it, but I'm pretty sure they just took the noodles and beef in my initial bowl and moved it to a new bowl of broth. Sorry, but that doesn't really fix the issue completely...\\n\\nStill, this is a pho place that I hold close to my heart and will visit again and again. Just be careful of bugs (mostly an issue in the warmer months, when the door to the restaurant is left open and bugs have easier access to the interior).\\n\\nNote that this place is cash only as well, and I don't think they typically split the bill between guests at a table.\",\n",

I tried the rice flakes as well. They were good, but not great.  Getting a mango shake offered a nice balance for my pho (since I've been known to put quite a bit of sriracha in my broth).  Finally, I agree with a few other reviewers, it was odd getting the check before I completed my meal.  Personally, that didn't impact my rating, but if it is something that is known to bother you, be warned. Oh, and remember it is CASH only!\\n\\n^If your interested in Pho, check out my ongoing list: http://www.yelp.com/list/philly-pho-philadelphia\",\n",
       "       \"One day I had a pho craving and didnt want to go to Saigon anymore. I happened across this small restaurant.\\n\\nCompared with the other Viet offerings in University City, I was pleasantly surprised.  The one standout of the pho was the broth. While at Saigon, another Viet restaurant in the area, I often times felt that the broth was watered down, just to present itself in such a big bowl, the broth here was very concentrated. \\n\\nEach sip was aromatic and fragrant with also a great hint of the meat used. The meat itself was similar to other pho I have had. One thing that stood out to me was the tendon, which was not tough or chewy like a lot of places but was more buttery and melted in your mouth. \\n\\nSo if you're in university city and craving some pho, I urge you to try this place out. Although I must say that for the avid pho connoisseur, he/she should look more towards places in viet town, this is a great option for those looking to get their quick pho fix.\",\n",
       "       'Cafe Saigon is the kind of authentic bare-bones restaurant you\\'d expect to find in Chinatown. The ambiance is somewhere between cheap takeout joint and fast-food restroom, the tables & chairs are ugly, and all the melamine spoons & chopsticks are conveniently already on the table and take up half of it. \\n\\nThat being said, the pho is everything I could hope for & more: a fragrant, delicious broth, abundant shrimp & pork, and the tastiest rice noodles nestled in the bottom of the bowl just waiting to be mixed in with a squirt of lime, a hot pepper slice or two, a soupcon of basil and a handful of sprouts. \\n\\nHaving been here 3 times, I\\'ve eaten the same soup each time because it\\'s too good to move on. The boy is a bit more adventurous and has tried two dishes. The dishes listed as rice flake are actually a fat rice noodle kind of like chow fun and have all manner of tasty pork bits atop. Delicious, but not enough to tempt me away from my pho for more than a forkful or two. \\n\\nI haven\\'t had many of their drinks, and it seems like they\\'re out of some of them every time, but I looooove the lychee drink. It\\'s quite refreshing and the lychee fruit makes a nice, sweet treat.\\n\\nThis may not be a fancy date place or an ideal first date \"gotta impress the lady with cloth napkins\" kinda joint, but it\\'s definitely a good place to grab an amazingly cheap and tasty meal. Two people can eat a healthy portion o\\' pho for under $20 (including tip). Add an appetizer and two fancy drinks and round the bill up to ~$30, and you\\'ve got yourself a fabulous food coma that\\'s completely recession-friendly. And if you need some romance, bring your date some flowers with all that left-over money.',\n",
       "       \"Best pho option on campus.\\n\\nA lot of my Vietnamese friends claim that Cafe Saigon does not have great pho by any standard, but on those cold nights when I'm craving a nice, piping bowl of beef pho, this place is where I turn to.\\n\\nThis BYO is a great place to get ones feet wet with pho if you've never tried before because of it's wide menu selection. Whether you're vegetarian or are unsure what type of meats to get in your bowl, this place accommodates all of these requests. When you're seated, they'll immediately take your order and bring out a plate of toppings, which includes bean sprouts, lime wedges, jalapeÃ±os, and basil leaves. Literally within three minutes of ordering, they'll bring out your bowls. I usually go with #17, the beef eye round, tendon, and tripe. I lovee adding as many toppings as I can into my bowl. The sourness of the lime is a great compliment to the savory broth, the spiciness of the jalapeÃ±o adds a nice singe, the bean sprouts adds a nice crunch, and the basil adds a nice fresh aftertaste.\\n\\nEvery time, I down the soup and leave an empty bowl. Not only do I think the food is tasty, it's also extremely affordable. This less than $10 meal is the best cure to chilly weather blues. I have yet to try their smoothies, but I've hard their avocado smoothie is out of this world.\\n\\nPros: price, speedy service, menu options\\nCons: not the most friendly servers\\n\\nDishes to try: pho!\",\n",
       "       \"Good pho option in University City with large portions at a decent price. We ordered the Pho Beef Eye Round, Flank And Brisket and Pho Shrimp for takeout. For both orders, the broth was separated from the raw ingredients. \\n\\nThe broth was piping hot when it was delivered which was surprising. For each dish, both the quantity of broth and ingredients (lime, bean sprouts, meat pieces, spicy sauce, and noodles) was enough for about 1.5-2 servings. So at $11.75, it's maybe not the cheapest or best pho, but still a decent value.\\n\\nThe beef eye round, flank, and brisket were all properly cooked and when added to the pho, took on a great meaty and fatty flavor. The shrimp were also well cooked and was good in the broth.\\n\\nOverall, the pho was solid but nothing extraordinary. Pho & Cafe Saigon is a very solid pho option if you're looking for something close to University City.\",\n",
       "       \"Due to feeling a bit under weather for the past couple of weeks soup has been on the menu a lot . And as a result I've been finding myself over here to satisfy my pho craving a lot. With Vietnam Cafe representing this definitely isn't anywhere near the best pho in West Philly. and as many have indicated this is nowhere near the the level of a lot of other places in Philly. But when you're looking for pho that's quick and pretty inexpensive Pho & Cafe Saigon  makes a pretty good second fiddle.\\n\\nI've only really done takeout so I can't comment on service, but the people working the counter are friendly enough. The noodles for the pho definitely isn't the greatest I've had. But the cuts of meat are plentiful, and the broth is exceptionally satisfying. and the spring rolls that I've picked up here were definitely satisfying. So over all when old man winter and hangover bugs are kicking your ass, this place has enough to get you back to your senses. And I really need to try those milkshakes!\",\n",
       "       \"Okay...so first things, wow. When I first tried this place out, I wasn't too impressed but that's probably because I got something I'm not used to eating. I got chicken pho since I'm on a 'no red meat' diet. I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating pho with beef or meatballs so it wasn't my cup of tea. I was definitely impressed with the customer service though. The owner gave us free dessert and a free smoothie and I looove free!!! That alone was good enough to keep me coming back, and boyyyyy let me tell you...I'm sho glad I did! lol. This time I was willing to have a cheat day and I opted for pho with beef and got rice with pork chops to share with my boyfriend and oh my God *foodgasm* it was amazing!!! Like I said, I grew up eating this food but this is the BEST Vietnamese restaurant I've been to thus far and I'll explain why. \\n\\n1) the pho - so I've always been the one to freakin add basically half a bottle of hoisin sauce and sriracha in my pho, but at this place that was not needed at all. Initially when they gave us the pho and a little bit of sauce on the side I was like huh?! This is def not gonna be enough for me...But it actually was! And that speaks volumes. That means the broth is good enough on it's own. \\n\\n2) the rice and pork chops - that thang came out glistening and sizzling like it was seducing me, but we were so full from the pho that we took it to-go. We ate it about 2-3 hours later and it stillllllll tasted amazing so that's how I know that it's good, period. \\n\\nThis time, they gave us free dessert again AND an appetizer as well which were fried wontons. Just exquisite. Crispy out the outside and full of flavor on the inside. \\n\\nThis is my new fav pho place and I'm never turning back. Everrr. If you're wondering if you should check it out, don't hesitate. Everything is good, from the customer service to the food. Plus they offer outdoor seating! What other pho places in Philly you know do that?!\",\n",

I didn't expect to be clean or decent as other usual Vietnamese pho restaurants BUT didn't expect to see small tiny little bugs or something floating in our soup!! My husband and I found them after eating more than half of it. (yes, we were too hungry to inspect the soup covering with bunch of cilantro and bean sprouts)\\nAnd the taste was Full of MSG (both Pho and fried rice).. Again, I usually expect to taste some of MSG when you eat pho, but the Pho at this place was overloaded with MSG I can swear. Even worse, the soup was too sweet. ( yuk!!! )\\nThe meat (eye round) was already fully cooked in the soup when served and absolutely flavorless. \\nMy hubby complained about those little bugs we found but they were just listening and didn't apologize or do anything about it.  Since we already ate most of them and paid them up front, we just walked away with nauseous feeling in our stomach.\",\n",

So I finally had to say \"Ok, I\\'ll check it out and put my taste buds to the test\" So I came here after riding around on my motorcycle with a few friends on a cold cold day. It was literally 30 degrees out and we were riding for at least 2 hours. So as you can see where this story is going, I needed some PHO to warm me up! So I always hear from other\\'s that the PHO here is watered down, so I gave it a shot. I ordered PHO with OX TAIL!! Oh my you do not realize how hard it is to find a PHO place that has this offered in Tucson, usually they offer the ox tail in CA but not in Tucson. I thought the only place I would find ox tail with my PHO would be at my parents house, who make their pho with it. However this was the first place in Tucson, that right there gave me a up 1! So I\\'m here cold and excited to waiting for my bowl of PHO, it finally came and overall it was pretty darn good, I\\'d have to say it is up there with my good ratings of PHO places. The broth tasted flavorful and the ox tail was simply amazing and tender. I was really shocked, I tasted no water\\'d down whatsoever and it really hit the spot! It even warmed me up from my bike ride journey home! I like this place and the price wasn\\'t too bad either! I would definitely come back here to enjoy my PHO with ox tail again and possible some other different dishes from the menu!',\n",
       "       \"I gotta be honest with you -- I'm just not that impressed.  Miss Saigon is bit of a walk away on Campbell so this place might be better distance-wise from campus, but if you have a car, go to Miss Saigon instead.\\n\\nThe pho here has no depth of flavor.  I've been here two or three times and got different bowls of pho, but they're just not that tasty.  As simple as pho sounds, there needs to be a fine balance of delicious goodness that goes into the broth -- it's a basic Vietnamese dish with a lot of soul, and I feel like you can judge any Vietnamese restaurant off the quality of its pho.  The pho here almost tastes watery with little flavor -- I find myself dumping in sriracha just to make it taste like something.  The food here is just bland.\\n\\nThe quality is not there.  I feel like the menu is almost too large for such a small restaurant to execute well.\\n\\nI've had boba from here as well, and I always end up with icy chunks that the bottom.\\n\\nReally, go to Miss Saigon.  They execute flawlessly and give you delicious Vietnamese cuisine for a better price.\",\n",
       "       \"I've been eating at Saigon Pho since I was a freshman at the U of A. Three years later, and the food is still good. I almost always get #35, the Pho Tai Nam. The broth is a yummy blend of sweet and savory, and the portions are big enough to leave me stuffed. The Taro Boba here is pretty good too --sadly they were out of Taro when I went to visit today. Although the food isn't as great as Miss Saigon's, its definitely convenient for students who live on campus. \\n\\nThe cashiers/servers are all college students and are friendly and courteous. However, when I visited today, my boba order took almost half an hour to get to me...and it never really got to me, per se. I came in during the beginning of the dinner rush period and I ordered a Passion Fruit smoothie and a #35. About fifteen minutes into my pho, I ask one of the cashiers where my drink is. He says they're swamped with orders and it'll take a couple of minutes to make. Fair enough.\\n\\nI finished my pho and sat waiting for another ten minutes or so and I see the same cashier drop off the drink at a different table and walk away. I walked up to said table and let them know about the mistake. They sheepishly handed me the drink and I left. Normally this doesn't happen, but it isn't the first time my drink order was forgotten. I give Saigon Pho a solid three stars for their food, ambience, and service (when my drink isn't missing!).\",\n",
       "       \"I love Pho! When I heard that Viet Pho was opening close to my home, I had to try it. I've been to all the Vietnamese spots in Cherry Hill and have eaten some very good Pho. My granddaughter and I started with an appetizer of shrimp and pork fried dumplings. They were deep fried--not pan fried as I was expecting. They were crunchy and the filling was tasty. My granddaughter had the shrimp Pho in a spicy broth with egg noodles. I chose the shrimp Pho in chicken broth and vermicelli. Both were hot and delicious. We both doctored up our Pho with the ubiquitous Sambal, Hoisin sauce, Thai basil, sprouts, chiles and lime juice. The noodles were perfectly cooked. The shrimps were big and juicy and there were plenty of them. The broth was delicious and satisfying. We finished with iced Vietnamese coffee. The service was impeccable. We will be back.\",\n",

Add in quality noodles, the sustenance of almost every culture, and a few other items ... so perfect but one needs an establishment willing to invest their effort to please the dining public!\\n\\nI want bright, shining and clean at my PHO choices.  Walking through the doors of this shopping plaza location the aroma of Pho struck home instantly and I hope I wasn't making audible sounds of pleasure but I was feeling happiness and anxious to get to the menu.\\n\\nService was super outstanding ... they were interested in me, willing to help with questions and patient as I debated the choices.\\n\\nSteamed dumplings and PHO ... my goodness the PHO is ultra reasonably priced, which of course is a big plus for Dave!! \\n\\nIn their simplicity dumplings offer diners a good opportunity to determine the quality of a kitchen.

The Pho was very good. And usually the Pho got better as you got deeper in to the bowl. All the flavors seemed to fall to the bottom.\\n\\nThe noodles came with lots of meat and veggies.

Granted, this place is all about the pho. Yes, Saigon Pho sells delicious spring rolls, baguettes, rice and also rice noodle dishes, but it's all about the pho. But, seriously, try the bun at least once! \\n\\nSaigon Pho can get quite popular during the lunch hour. Depending on your arrival time, you might find yourself changing your order to go, or sitting outside in the strange little gravel area right in front of the parking lot. I know, I know -- this isn't the spot to take a new date if you are looking for some romance. But it is the place to take a date -- or a few friends -- if you want some casual good eats. \\n\\nIn fact, it is quite common to see groups of folks eating here. And because the orientation of the space is somewhat weird -- the building cuts in, consuming much needed seating -- it is community style in some areas. Two large tables sit smack in the middle of the establishment, and strangers are not shy about sharing the table, which is just wonderful to see.\\n\\nI often get my order to go, but I do love the ambiance. \\n\\nAs for the food, I tend to get the oxtail and rare beef pho or the bun with BBQ pork and vermicelli. I love, LOVE the oxtails here! They somehow manage to cut every single little piece of fat off the meat, cooking it until it yields its rich, earthy flavor. \\n\\nAnd the broth is so light and lovely with a tinge of sweetness from the fish sauce. And I appreciate that on those many days when I opt not to order the noodles or rice, the staff is quite accommodating offering cuts of vegetables instead. \\n\\nI also love that no seasoning is ever required. OK -- maybe some Sriracha on my fiery days. But the seasoning is on point! I don't even understand why salt and fish sauce or even hoisin are placed on the table. \\n\\nOther things to try: the lemongrass tofu baguette -- so refreshing and filling and perfect for Tucson's summer days; the curry fish -- don't be thrown off by the shape of the fish. Yes, it's weird, but the flavor is decadent. \\n\\nAlso, the vegetarian menu is huge. And they have boba with a ton of flavors, like apple, mango, pineapple, passion fruit and papaya.\",\n",

However, sizing was comparable to other places in Jersey, but the flavor was definitely better ... still not like Philly\\'s (though probably healthier with less MSG).  The highlight was my just-rightly spiced and slightly sweet-sour soup with slightly doughier rounded rice noodles vs. the usual flat rice pho noodles. \\n\\nOverall ... a very pleasant surprise that we\\'ll likely return to when we have less time and can\\'t make it into Philly!',\n",

Was pretty much tasteless.

It was Americanised to the max, probably more like an Asian fusion restaurant. Where does everyone get the hype from???? The fresh rolls, sure, they weren't bad. But they weren't exceptional, but where can you go wrong with a spring roll. You have a rice paper wrap and you just compile your ingredients into it. So simple, even I can make it at home. \\n\\nAnyway, I digress. You'll find authentic pho elsewhere. If you're in need for a quick unexceptional lunch, go here!\",\n",

Pretty simple - nothing special, but comfortable.  \\n\\nI started off with two of their rolls, which are like double the size of an egg roll.  The rolls are wrapped in rice paper with vegetables and many different choices of meat and fillings.  I got a BBQ pork and their kickin chicken.

You could probably stop at a couple of rolls, but I was hungry and got a short rib pho - like your normal pho with slow braised short ribs.  I actually liked the rolls a bit better than than pho, but it was still very good.  The short rib was a bit off though - it tasted fine, but I just don't know if it's a great pho ingredient.  No matter, I liked it, and it certainly earned a return trip.  Still lots on the menu to try.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, not at all your traditional Vietnamese restaurant.

It would've been nice if she could've just told me to order at the register before 2-3 clients got in line. While I was waiting in line, a gentlemen was behind me and I overheard him telling his friend that he didn't like the pho here because the broth was too sweet. I was thinking about leaving but I was already there for 10 minutes so I just decided to try it for myself. I waited about 20 minutes for my pho, which I understand it could get busy. I'm a patience person that's not the reason why I'm giving 1 star. \\n\\nMajority of pho vietnamese restaurants that I've went to the past doesn't add bean sprouts to the pho. They bring out a side dish of bean sprout separately and its up to the person eating it to decide if they want to add that or not. I also tasted ginger and I hate ginger. The pho had mainly bean sprout and barely any noodles. I remember ordering a pho noodle not bean sprout noodles. Also, the broth was sweet. I usually eat my pho with the broth, but I didn't like the broth taste. I didn't try anything else here so I don't know much about the other food. However, I do not recommend getting pho from here.

I am craving it right now.  It is a literal boat of soup and not much makes me happier than A LOT of something I love.  Tender rice noodles, tasty vegetable broth, mountains of fresh veggies, and fried tofu floating on top.  Please and thank you.  I'll take mine with extra sriracha please.  \\n\\nThis place is right downtown and the pho came fast even though we had a big group of people.  Lots of options to add to your bowl too.  There may even be a little Yelp check in treat waiting for you to boot.  Enjoy!\",\n",
       "       'Service is alright. Food is abysmal. \\n- \"fresh rolls\" ...what does that mean? they\\'re spring rolls. anyways, when we ordered it we received one \"fresh roll\" cut in half. rip off. poorly rolled. i\\'m assuming they wait until the rice paper is completely softened before they roll it. \\n- crab rangoon\\'s were served with some type of spicy mayo? why not sweet chili sauce? there is already cream cheese inside, why add another heavy sauce for the dipping sauce? \\n- ordered a white peach tea. tea was luke warm in the pot and served with a coffee mug. this is \"extra\" for no reason, the pot is so small you can pour the entire thing into the coffee mug. i don\\'t know why it was luke warm. \\n- bean sprouts served with pho were already browned, and the portions they were served in were so small. bean sprouts are so inexpensive, load it up! and keep it fresh. i had a tiny dish of brown bean sprouts with a single slice of jalapeÃ±o. if you go to any other vietnamese restaurant, i would have 20x more. \\n- why was the pho served with red onion? i like red onion, but pho is traditionally served with white onion and green onion \\n- while my pho was \"hot\" it was 10 minutes away from being lukewarm. the noodles were soggy, as if they were boiled before the broth was poured over it. rice noodles are so thin that if you pour boiling pho broth over it, it will cook the noodles instantly \\n- my mom also complained that her curry was \"warm\" as opposed to \"hot\" \\n- the papaya salad was good. i don\\'t usually eat it, so i have no reference. but much more research needs to be done to follow the guidelines of traditional vietnamese food. it will save you time and money!',\n",
       "       'I ate here three times during my four day stay in Tampa. I haven\\'t had good pho in quite a while, so I was really happy to find this place. I had the pho for dinner twice, and bun (noodle bowl) at the buffet style lunch once. I definitely prefer the dinner service to the buffet lunch (this is the only reason I\\'m taking off one star). The lunch was just not as fresh as the dinner meal that I had. \\n\\nThe summer rolls are HUGE. I saw a few people eating them as a meal rather than an appetizer. The pho \"boats\" are also large and contain plenty of noodles and meat. The broth is flavorful and delicate. I do wish they put tripe and tendon in their pho dac biet, but even without these ingredients, the dish was satisfying. The prices are also reasonable. I definitely recommend this place for dinner if you\\'re in downtown Tampa and feel like having some pho.',\n",
       "       \"I had the Gluten Free Kick'n Chick'n with Chicken pho ...\\n\\nI usually order Shrimp Pho, because I had been scarred elsewhere having Chicken pho. I still feel that pho is better with shrimp... However since this was a fusion place I decided to have chicken, and I'm glad I did. This pho was off the chain, and I have had pho all over Tampa and in NYC.\\n\\nMy number one is still Pho Hoang in Brandon, for shrimp pho. However, the chicken pho here is probably my number 1 pick in that category. The Kick'n Chick'n was fantastic with a side of sweet chili .\\n\\nThe presentation spectacular and it's a great evening date location. Bravo !\",\n",
       "       \"I gave this place 3 stars because the food here is hit or miss. It's more of an Asian fusion-y place than a pure, authentic Vietnamese restaurant. I have been here twice now and I have tried their several of their fresh rolls -- BBQ Pork, Kick'n Chik'n, Seoul, and Crabby. All of them except for the BBQ Pork roll was pretty disappointing, but the BBQ Pork roll is off the chain! I think the next time I come here, I'm just going to give up on trying all the cool, different fresh rolls and just stick with the BBQ Pork roll.\\n\\nWe also got the 5-spiced pork bahn mi sliders (came with 3 sliders), which were SOOO good. Probably my favorite thing that I've gotten off this menu. For those who don't know, bahn mi is a Vietnamese sandwich that's usually served on a baguette with pork, cilantro, pickled carrots, daikon radishes, cucumbers, etc. The sliders were absolutely fantastic, and the 5-spiced pork was delicious. We had the crab rangoons, as well, and they were some of the best crab rangoons I've ever had. Lots of crab meat and less cream cheese-y than most faux Asian places, and the wonton it came in was soft and fresh-tasting. \\n\\nThe pho (beef noodle soup) here didn't taste completely authentic but still good. The pho boats are HUGE and are good for sharing (or not, if you're hungry and don't overload on appetizers!). Best pho in South Tampa that I've had but if you want really good, authentic pho, I'd still go to the North Tampa places (Saigon Bay, Pho Quyen, etc.). \\n\\nWith a foursquare check-in, there was a special where you could get a free 5-spice carrot cupcake (which is odd because it is not listed on their regular menu). I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake usually, but it was not bad at all, and the cream cheese icing was very yummy.\",\n",
       "       'We visit Bamboozle whenever we need to get our Pho fix - and I will say one thing: they are 100% consistent.  Below is my review from 2 years ago.  Nothing has changed - which in one way is good and in another, bad.  I really, really wish the owner would listen (and I have contacted her directly) to some constructive criticism.  The issue is the ridiculous lines because people are ordering custom rolls.  That is fine - but if all you want is Pho or Noodle Salad (Bun), which are essentially pre-made - you should NOT HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE for 15-20 minutes!!!   Here is my previous review:  Having lived in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest for several years, I have come to really enjoy and appreciate a variety of Asian cuisine. There are probably 50+ Pho places in Seattle, and I\\'ve tried at least a dozen of them. Bamboozle does Pho and Vietnamese cuisine a good service; it is authentic and fresh. The Pho and Bun (noodle salad with protein of your choice) are great. The prices are reasonable considering the amount of food and freshness of the ingredients ($8-10). The only downside to Bamboozle are the TERRIBLE lines around lunch hour. Most of the back-up is caused by one factor: people getting custom rice paper hand rolls. While I appreciate this touch, it really backs up the line for other customers who want Pho or Noodle Salad - both of which take a mere fraction of the time to prepare. I strongly suggest an express line be created for customers who has \"quick\" orders such as Pho or salad, as these items are 90% pre-done.',\n",
       "       \"Bamboozle Cafe is a tricky review for me to write.\\n\\nOn the one hand, I love the downtown location, the interior art and the pho broth is quite tasty. In fact, it was the tastiest broth I found while visiting Tampa. So, when I spotted Oxtail pho on the menu, I decided to try it because A) I love oxtails and B) I've never seen oxtail pho on any pho menu before. \\n\\nHowever, to my severe disappointment, the oxtail meat was bland, tasteless, super fatty and completely untrimmed of the tough skin-like cartilage that surrounds the meat. I was totally baffled that this seems acceptable to serve to customers. Not to mention the gnarly bone in the middle made it very difficult to eat this as a soup. Too hot to use your fingers to hold it while using your teeth to grab the meat and not quite tender enough to use a fork to tear off the meat from the bone. Also, the size difference between their two pho bowls definitely lends to the term 'bamboozled'.\\n\\nService is kinda Chipotle-ish and the interior becomes void of natural light the further back into the restaurant you go. Being a person who enjoys natural light, I would have preferred to sit closer to the front of the store but there was no room for our party of nine there. The back dining area had interesting art on the walls, but the dark colored ceilings and lack of windows had me feeling very enclosed and claustrophobic. Sometimes you just can't put your finger on what bothers you about a business, but for me, the cave-like interior towards the rear immediately rubbed me wrong. If you want to torture me, put me in a place that has no windows, very little natural light and dark colors. \\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHT \\n\\nAs a reward for using the yelp mobile app to check-in, you will be offered a large cupcake of your choice. It was a nice gesture, but the cupcake itself was just ok. I do believe Bamboozle is a solid place for pho, despite the fact they don't serve a meatball pho (my favorite). The pho boats are enormous, but I would encourage the owner to braise & season the oxtail meat to help tenderize it and give it more flavor. It would also be nice to trim the fat/cartilage and debone it to make it easier to eat as a soup. \\n\\nI brought local Tampa friends with me to try pho for the very first time and they found the broth & noodle pho (no meat) to be pretty fantastic. Reviews seem to give high praise to the sandwiches, so maybe next time I'm in town I will give the Banh Mi or perhaps the seafood pho a try. \\n\\nOverall - Pho broth (4.5 stars), Oxtail meat and free carrot cupcake (1 star)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2016/26\",\n",
       "       \"I've never seen a fast food Vietnamese joint before.  Vietnamese food is usually fast already, but they've Americanized the setting.  It's set up like a salad cafe or burrito place, like Chipotle, where people get in line and tell the employee what they want and get to choose what goes in it.  First for everything and it works.  I really like the concept and appreciate how they tried to stay within a theme, even though they're a cafe.  \\n\\nFor fast food Vietnamese, this place is really good.  I had their beef pho and goi cuon (spring roll) or what they call Bamboozle roll.  Both were yummy, although the pho was a little pricier than average.  The Bamboozle roll is definitely Americanized.  You can add all kinds of vegetables not normally found in goi cuon.  It's good though because you can make it even healthier than it already is and it's pretty cheap.  Pho Quyen still serves the best pho in Tampa bay, but I would still come here if I'm in the area and craving Vietnamese.  \\n\\nI bet in a few years this place will turn into a chain.  I wish a place like this would open up in south Tampa and Brooklyn, NY (specifically in Fort Greene/ Clinton Hill area) soon.  There aren't enough good Vietnamese restaurants in my neighborhood. (*Hint, hint to the owners or any entrepreneurs out there.  If I had the money and time, I would jump all over opening a place like this: fast, fresh, and healthy.)\",\n",

So hey, I\\'m always down for a big bowl of pho. \\n\\nIt was kind of quiet when we walked in and we were seated immediately. The decor is...fine. I mean really who cares. I\\'m not here for the ambiance. I\\'m on a soup mission. Have I mentioned how much I LOVE pho? Pho is life. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty decent and I found a pho that looked interesting and not typical of what I\\'d seen offered other places. \\n\\nI received complementary jasmine tea and hubby stuck to water. I chose an adventurous dish, but also one that did NOT include tripe. I\\'m just not ready for that kind of crazy. I settled on a #18 and hubby got a vermicelli pork bowl. \\n\\nOur food arrived VERY quickly. Like shockingly fast. Awesome. \\n\\nMy pho broth was very flavourful and was filled with various cuts of lean and fattier meat. There was also a large chunk of fatty tendon that was absolutely delectable! You can see it floating happily in the front part of my bowl. Hello beautiful. It was a mellow beefy flavour and the texture was buttery soft and SO delicious. \\n\\nHubby\\'s vermicelli noodle bowl was very tasty, but he\\'s less fond of fat and connective tissue, and his pork was not as lean as he likes, so that was a slight miss for him. I enjoyed his leftovers immensely. \\n\\nWe will absolutely be back, and hopefully hubby will find something more suitable for his taste. \\n\\nPs. If Pamela our Yelp community manager is reading this, I think our city needs a Pho challenge so we can crown the \"best of Edmonton\" pho. I can help judge. Just saying....'],\n",

The broth didn't have as much depth, there was not much meat, and the meat provided didn't taste as fresh as some other places in the area.  On the other hand, the restaurant was busy both times I went, so they must be serving SOMETHING delicious.  Someone tell me what it is!  And I can't say I minded my dinner costing only $6.43 tonight.\\n\\nOverall impression - a place with a too-large menu, causing quality to suffer in some cases, and a place that tries to cut corners for the sake of cost.

The second time I got the papaya salad with beef jerky, shaky beef, and canh (sour soup) with fish. The papaya salad was horrible, the green papaya was tough, like it had been shaved and left in the fridge uncovered and dried out. The shaky beef was very tasty but perhaps a bit overcooked. The canh was very good, though they could add more color (e.g. tomatoes, brighter vegetables) to make it look more appealing. The rice also was nice, it  was the whitest rice I've seen.

However, the fish sauce that they provided are super bland. Normally, the fish sauce for com tam and bun thit nuong should be different; however, this place uses the same fish sauce for these two different items.

Easily the best pork fried rice I have ever had. It would seem that some places treat the venerable old pork fried rice dish as an aged relative to be stuffed in a recliner and tended to only in the most minimal sense, but here at Pho Quyen, the pork is not some questionable amalgam of odd pink meat, but clearly cut from a real pig! I also enjoyed the honeydew boba tea, but Thuy Cafe's is superior and is not too far from Pho Quyen. This is a worthwhile place to try at least once and probably 3 or 4 times and a good base line for decent pho in the bay area. Not the best, but a good place to get an idea of a good quality offering of my favorite soup.\",\n",

It\\'s that good! I got the \"have it ur way\" pho w/ beef, rare flank steak, rare brisket and beef meatballs. This time I tried the Northern style. I love the southern but the northern is now my new favorite! It has beef broth instead of chicken broth. Also it comes with cilantro, which I like. All in all it was way more than I could eat. The restaurant was cleaner than on previous trips there. And the server I had today was the best I\\'ve had there. Food came out quick and right. Very good experience and will be back again.',\n",
       "       \"PVR has some tasty pho. I am never disappointed by the quality and overall ingredients. The pho soup broth is outstanding. I rarely order anything else off the menu because their pho is that good. The only reason I'm not giving them five stars is for two reasons. One, their pho is somewhat pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. Two, they have no bahn mi sandwiches listed on their menu. I want to try bahn mi sometimes and I have no options here at PVR. \\n\\nI just wanted to add that the service here is very good. The waiters are prompt, friendly, and deliver the food in under ten minutes. The ambience has improved a bit over the past couple years too. It was a total dive a couple of years ago and is now only somewhat of a dive.  :)\",\n",

(My order had no sausages, two red potatoes, and three corn which I was charged extra for). We got the oysters which had some ave size to tiny sized ( about half your thumb, couldn't believe they would put that on the plate). We got the Asian wings which was good but overwhelmingly salty to the point where it wasn't desirable. Tone down the fish sauce in the seasoning and these would be banging. Then I got fries and the Cajun wing (these wings were so tiny compare to the whole Asian wings). Prob can do without it. Overalls I gave it 4 stars bc this place has potential. I would prob wait until everything is in season for seafood.. Huge taste difference from fresh to frozen. I would just come back for the crawfish and oysters.\",\n",

They separate the noodles from the main soup with the usual side of bean sprouts, basil and a lime wedge, this is to prevent the noodles from spoiling in the soup when it soaks up too much water.

I was disappointed as you can tell.  The sauce did not have the kick I was anticipating, kinda bland really. I was comparing them to Boiling Crab in Houston and Boat House in Brooklyn as I was thrilled to hear of a crawfish place near my house!

The seafood is cooked perfectly and the crabby Cajun sauce (regular and spicy) is so delicious and addictive!\\n\\nThe pho is disappointing. It comes in a giant bowl that's pretty much all soup and they're always out of some component and have to sub in other ingredients. Speaking of missing ingredients, they always seem to be out of something. In my most recent visit, it was potatoes for the crawfish boil, beef for the pho, and blue crabs.

I got a regular sized bowl of chicken pho, and my fiancÃ© got a seafood pho. Just FYI, the regular size bowl is HUGE! I didn't try his, so I can't speak for the flavor, but mine was fabulous. The broth was pristine, very clear but still full bodied. It was seasoned perfectly, not overly salty, and it was very light with no grease or fat like some broths have. The noodles were toothy, and wonderfully cooked. But most impressive was the freshness of the accompaniments.

Sometimes the service requires some waving down, but for a bowl of amazing soup, my needs are meager.\\n\\nPS- I generally dislike doing anything in Brandon that I don't have to.

He didn't want to be at work and it was crystal clear by how he acted. The table reeked! Of old stale water and old dirty rag. Thankfully they leave wipes on the table so I used about three to get the smell out. I placed an order for summer rolls and asked for no pork, P7 which is pho with your choice of meats, and a vegetables pho. The rolls were brought out with just pork and no shrimp, complete opposite of what we ordered and was later told there was no shrimp...ok? The pho broths were ok. I did like the tender noodles and great amount of meats. However, didn't receive sprouts or mint, limes, nothing. I go back to the service because it was just horrible. Most likely my only and last time going here. There certainly many many better choices around.\",\n",

We waited 5 minutes for our drink order and the waiter was hard to understand even though she was young. She didn't understand that I wanted the young coconut drink and was about to make me a coconut slush so we just opted for water. She took our orders without writing it down and repeated it back to us wrong to which we corrected her and she went about her way and we were worried that she wasn't going to get it right. She came out 10 minutes later with one appetizer and then another 5 for the other appetizer and then 10 minutes later with our pho. It was just everywhere. The prices has increased and it's obvious with the sticker over the old price so that was a surprise. The noodles in the pho were so soft and they were breaking as we picked them up to eat.

I'm going to stick my neck out and declare this the best Pho in Indy. Nowhere else can you get pho soup that is as rich, herby, and flavorful. The ones on the west side of town are loaded with MSG (I'm talking about you Saigon, Sizzling Wok Hai, and King Wok). \\n\\nMy only gripe is that the soup is a little on the sour side. Why give us lime wedges if the soup is already this sour!?\\n\\nAnyways, the bowl comes with a full complement of bean sprouts, jalopenos, and basil (which is essential to the flavor profile... I don't understand how Viet Bistro down the street leaves basil out). \\n\\nThe meat is fresh and ample. Viet Bistro barely gives you any.\\n\\nI think that they're doing Vietnamese food justice. Their menu is super simple and has about 3-4 Vietnamese classics. The problem with most restaurants is that they have so many items so everything sucks equally bad. V Cafe is focused.\\n\\nWhen I went in most of the diners were Vietnamese. That's how you know you've found a good ethnic restaurant.\\n\\nAlso, their boba was not bad at all. Better than most of the top results on yelp for boba/bubble tea. It wasn't made from a powder and have that gritty texture that you usually get in Indy.\",\n",

Honestly, on a warm summer night, there are few things that are better than sitting outside on the corner of 43rd and Spruce and watching the world go by with a big bowl of pho. \\n\\nInsofar as food recommendations go, I always start with an appetizer of sorts, usually an order of spring rolls. The pho is great, so just pick whichever mix of assorted meat parts you want (don't fear the tripe and the tendon, they're both delicious) or, if you'd prefer, the salads are great too (and filling!)\\n\\nThis place has always, always been consistent and if you're in West Philly there's no reason not to go.\",\n",

Maybe it's because my first experience with pho was a bad one (lettuce turning pink, ick!)\\n\\nThis time around, I was wiser and went with their vermicelli only option with pork. I ate that whole bowl having learned my lesson about ordering apps at southeast asian restaurants! As many are saying, their menu is very limited with maybe two appetizers, a rice bowl, and three pho options. But I think this works well in their favor-- they have just a few dishes that they want to perfect, and they certainly did that with my vermicelli bowl!\\n\\nApart from this, the place is pretty spartan, and only one other couple was there the whole time I dined, a Friday at lunch.

       "       \"This used to be my favorite Pho place.  My co-workers and I came in at least once a week.  Then they switched out the chili sauce they put on the table.  The old one complimented the Pho well and had great flavor.  The new one tastes like pickled peppers and does not.  Now I can't get that spicy Pho I like since I can't stand this new chili sauce/paste.\",\n",
       "       \"The pho is not pho-nominal (sorry) and the food is not very Saigon.  The sandwiches are a great snack though.\\n\\nThe pho comes in a big bowl and comes with cilantro, lime, jalapenos, and bean sprouts.  I ordered the pho dac biet.  The steak looks like it was cut from a perfect cylinder of beef on a deli slicer.  It was tender, but its unusual shape made it difficult for me to tell what cut of beef it was.  For being the 'variety bowl' of the menu, it was lacking a variety and quantity of meats in comparison to other pho restaurants.  No fatty flank but tripe and meatballs were present.  The broth is more subtle than most I have had so it was easier to slurp when you finish everything else in the bowl.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are a great value.  I would choose a freshly baked baguette over a five-dollar-footlong any day.  Again, there was a lack of protein.  However, I won't complain at $3.50 for a sandwich.  The bread had a crusty exterior with a warm fluffy interior.  The carrots and jicama (I think it was jicama) were pickled with just enough tang and crunch.  The express special is the way to go.  The BBQ pork was a little dry.  The ham and egg only comes with a single egg, and they served it to me with no egg so I had to send it back.  I don't know how the server missed it considering it's a single fried egg smack dab on top when she gave it to me.  It would be an interesting 'fusion' of Vietnamese/French/American for a breakfast sandwich with two eggs.\\n\\nEverything aside from the sandwiches are overpriced, but I'll give some of them a try since the location is convenient.\",\n",
       "       \"Saigon Pho is deeply underwhelming.  Aside from smoothies, there is virtually nothing with flavor on their menu.  Salad rolls?  Flaccid tubes of damp vermicelli and iceberg lettuce.  Banh mi?  A baguette drier than the Gobi desert topped with a few isolated pieces of dessicated meat or tofu.  Where is the Vietnamese mayo?  Where is the delicious mix of pickled carrots and daikons?  Why is there only one slice of jalapeÃ±o and a single sprig of cilantro?  Their pho broth is uneven and, while they don't skimp on the noodles, you will find yourself wishing for something more substantial than a fishbowl of cheap starch.\\n\\nIf this was purely a food review, they would be closer to a three, but their prices seriously exceed their quality level.  $8.00 is fair for a delicious, meaty bowl of pho, but they will charge you that for a vegetable soup that lacks both vegetables and flavor.  $4.50 is high for banh mi, especially when it lacks toppings and goes down like sandpaper.  \\n\\nThe service is hit or miss--most of the staff seem to be glazed undergrads who don't care whether the restaurant succeeds or fails.

You need to have good bread, and not just any old bread, the type of bread that made that specific sandwich famous. And the french baguette at Saigon Pho hit it right on the nose. RidAKulousness! \\n\\n Also had the #23 Pho with brisket and meatballs.  The broth was too beefy and not floral enough, and was waaaaay too peppery.

Half the rice stick noodles were cold and were sticking to each other so they probably just quickly heated up those noodles.

I almost always get the bun though, because I am addicted to it.  The bun is not that great, there is a ton of filler lettuce on the bottom, and not many other veggies, so it is unsatisfying.  I usually end up sneaking many tastes of my husband's pho (It is the beef rare and brisket).  So, I am not sure why I always order bun.

So I get back to my office and the vermicelli are like spaghetti noodles, not what I was expecting but a minor flaw.  I was willing to overlook that.  Then I open the curry.  There were potatoes, odd consistency and like two tiny scraps of chicken and not quality chicken.  Outside of this the curry itself did not have a good flavor.  Look, I'm no curry expert but I do love the stuff (African, Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, whatever) and this just wasn't good.  So, I will not be going back.

It usually fills me up, but depending on who is the kitchen that day, sometimes there is a nice heaping amount of rice noodles, or (and this is rare) just enough to make me full for the time being, but still leaves me hungry an hour later.\\n\\nThe baguettes here are delicious and cheap for such an enormous sandwich.  Go for the ham and egg if you are really hungry.  My favourites are the ham or the turkey and the tofu is great for vegetarians.  I think they also offer vegetarian meats here.  Unfortunately, the texture is just not the same, and in my opinion, tofu is better for both the pho and the baguettes.\\n\\nAs for the drinks, I love the smoothies here.  I often go for a taro smoothie simply because I love the richness of it, but other fruit flavours are yummy too.  One of friends always orders the durian smoothie because it's made from fresh fruit (the other flavours are made from mixes I believe).  I can never stomach the smell or taste of durain, but he loves it.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend ordering their drinks with boba.  In the smoothies, they tend to freeze up and become icy; in the teas, they are usually too hard and take forever to chew.\",\n",

The banh mi sandwiches do look tasty, but I haven't had the chance to try them yet. If you're in the mood for some good authentic pho, you're better off waiting the extra 15 minutes at Miss Saigon.

The only thing Vietnamese about it is that the owner is Viet but has nothing to do with the actual production of the food or well being of the store. \\n\\nI ordered the PHO Beef and it was terrible.

The bean sprouts are sunk at the bottom of the bowl and they literally give you ONE basil leaf. ONE basil leaf?! are you kidding me? \\n\\nThe only kind of meat they use is pre cooked meat and it sits there to be ordered (the meat they use is suppose to be raw or semi-raw). man, \\n\\nDISTGUSTING pho for 8.50 plus tax. \\n\\nWhat a disgrace to done this place as \"Vietnamese.\"\\n\\nThis is just pitiful.',\n",

Really solid.\\n\\nNow, the not-so-good:\\n\\n- The oxtails in my pho (it looked intriguing on the menu, and the server suggested it was excellent) were beyond tough... I expected fall-off-the-bone, but the meat had obviously not been cooked long enough to be edible.\\n\\n- My son\\'s panko chicken was rare in the middle\\n\\n- Service was slow throughout the meal; took almost 10 minutes to receive water after we sat down, the special \"hot sake\" was barely lukewarm, and getting our server\\'s attention was a challenge.\\n\\n- The worst part is that we brought these issues up to our server (especially since we couldn\\'t enjoy our entrees), and he shrugged and walked away without even a simple \"sorry.\"  I realize it may have been a busy evening, but if a customer brings up undercooked food, I expect at least an acknowledgment (and hopefully an apology).\\n\\nMaybe it was just a bad evening, but I\\'d recommend tempering your expectations here.',\n",

The chicken was cooked, dry and wrapped in a plastic wrap before they add it to your pho. They were big pieces too, normally you get thin slices no these were chunks of chicken, wasn't really how I like it. I also look forward to flavorful broth and I would give this a 3 out of 5. I always try it before adding in anything. The tea was also weak. Felt bamboozled...\",\n",

I've also had the sesame glass noodles which have a spicy sauce you can add that has some kick to it. Those were really good too.

Execution could have been better. Everything was instagrammable but bland. It doesn't really taste like real Viet food - there's no fish sauce or the appropriate spices like peppercorn or star anise. The pho broth was oily and also bland. Also saddened by the workers there mispronouncing everything on the menu. \\n\\nThe boozle coffee was viet coffee with toffee. Very yummy but too sweet. I would suggest cutting the condensed milk since the toffee acts as a sweetener. Overall satisfying though!\",\n",

Wine choices are few but decent. They help with paring if you need. I love the seafood boat I can make 3 meals out if it! Last night I tried the ultimate papaya salad with tiger shrimp. I'll be ordering this again! Better in the summer than the boats. Pho is amazing chicken or the vegan option. Make reservations on Tuesdays for the Pho it is super popular and busy!\",\n",

The environment inside the restaurant is nice and cozy and is great for groups. \\n\\nMy three star rating comes from the food itself. If you're looking for a real, authentic PHO experience then this might not be the place for you. I am a pho enthusiast so I know when the broth is not right or the meat hasn't cooked well or the noodles are too thin and mushy, which are all the things I experienced here. It felt very Americanized to me and I feel like eating pho should be a cultural experience. Needless to say I came here on a Tuesday where they serve $5 pho (chicken, beef, or veggie) but in my opinion I don't see myself paying any more than that. Overall it was a cute establishment and I appreciate the experience!\",\n",

It\\'s like they used powdered beef bouillon to make the broth. I ordered a tiny sample bowl and even that I didn\\'t finish. They don\\'t even offer tripe, beef tendon etc (aka Classic Pho Dac Biet) but instead have just eye round, chicken, or vegan flavor. This place is very Americanized and we did not enjoy it one bit but were very hungry and wanted Vietnamese (I wanted com suon and nope! Not offered!!) the crispy spicy chicken rolls aren\\'t bad. P.S. beware ! Cross contamination at best here. I watched the lady assemble the dish and it left the rarely cooked beef and went right into cilantro and sprouts and onions. No no. Sure she wore gloves but what does it matter if the beef is touching everything else! Why offer vegan soup if it\\'s gonna be using the same toppings as the ones the beef touched! Anyway. I hate to say it but they need to revamp. My papi is in the bathroom moments after probably cuz of the cross contamination. And they do not tend to their bathrooms. Disgusting \"marks\" after someone\\'s obvious cross contamination incident I suppose.',\n",
       "       \"I may have visited Bamboozle on a bad day, but everything I tried was plain /bad/. I ordered the pork bun, and it was all so bland. The pork was tough and cold. Nothing tasted fresh. I also tried the beef pho with oxtail. The noodles were not cooked all the way and were very tough. The broth was incredibly bland. The oxtail in the pho was the best part of Bamboozle. It was fall off the bone tender. I felt bad it's only an add-on to the pho, and not shining on its own. \\n\\nA Yelp check-in gets you a free cupcake. I chose the carrot cake cupcake. That was dry too. Everything except the oxtail was badddd. The oxtail isn't good enough to save this place, so skip this place and visit BT To Go instead if you're craving Vietnamese food.\",\n",

It is very cute too. It is decorated to look like an outside garden or patio.\\n\\nMy server brought me some water with cucumber and mint in it, such a nice touch! I ordered the beef pho. They bring out your veggies on a plate, as well as the sauces in separate cups so no one is using the same siracha bottle or spice tray. When the pho comes, you can add in your veggies and spice. \\n\\nWhile I was there, they must have had 10 or more take out orders so they are clearly popular with the people who live nearby. \\n\\nI love grabbing dinner before a show and hopefully once they start getting live shows up and running again in a safe manner I'll be visiting the downtown restaurants again more frequently.\",\n",

The positive reviews made the restaurant seem promising but in my opinion, it fell short of my expectations. \\n\\nI ordered the beef pho which came with exactly three slices of tough, chewy beef. The broth was lukewarm and the noodles were not cooked thoroughly and were still tough. The noodles also had a starchy flavor. This is because the water that the noodles are submerged in was not at a full boil and was not switched out often enough. The aroma of the broth had the right flavors but it wasn't strong enough to taste like authentic pho. Hence, the extra star for effort. \\n\\nI checked in on yelp and got a free Vietnamese coffee cupcake. I also felt that the cupcake was disappointing even though it was free. It was extremely dense and cold. It did not have a strong coffee flavor and the frosting consistency was off. \\n\\nI normally would try a place a couple times before reviewing but I'm not sure I would come back here.
